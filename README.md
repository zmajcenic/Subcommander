Gameplay
--------
Control your submarine and sink as many ships as possible. You can fire up to 4 torpedoes at the same time.
They will slowly accelerate and will take some time to reload.
There is a layer of indestructible obstacles (plastic floatsome) which will destroy your torpedoes and provide no points.
Sunk ships provide more points the higher they are. Exceptions are:
- high priority target (red mark) which yields double points
- civilian target (green mark) which will deduct you 999 points
Ships also drop mines. If you get hit you will loose 555 points and be disabled for a few seconds.
Special keys:
STOP - pause the game
CTRL+STOP - end game and return to main screen
